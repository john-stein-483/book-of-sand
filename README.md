# book-of-sand
This repo is mostly going to be a training ground for app/coding ideas.  
The Book of Sand is a short story by Jorge Borges.  It's been a long time since I read it, but it's basically a story about a book that is constantly evolving and never retains its content, even when you go back pages.  It seems like a solid project idea to start messing with.
